# Piping

- What if you want to connect the standard output of one command so that it flows into the standard input of another command. 
- Each Linux command is designed to do one task extremely well.
- Piping is all about taking the standard output of one command and connecting it to the standard input of another command.

```linux
~$ date

show us date

~$ date 1> date.txt
```



- How would we cut out just the day of the week?

```
~$ cut 0< date.txt --delimiter " " --fields 1    --> broken into column with a space

--> delimiter: what divides the columns because spaces are what 										divided up these specific column in files

--> space is what delimited in this file

2019
```



 | : pipe symbol



- We can pipe the standard output of the data command directly into the standard input of the cut command.

```linux
~$ date | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 

2019

~$ date | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 > today.txt

2019

~$ date | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1 > today.txt --fields 1

2019
```



- How would instead of saving it into a file , how would we send the data from the command into another command. You just add another pipe.

```linux
~$ date | cut --delimiter=" " --field=1 | command -options args(arguments)


~$ date > date.txt | cut --delimiter=" " --fields 1


```



# Piping (Part 2) - tee

- tee commander allows us to pass the data on the rest of the pipe
- But it also allows us to keep it in a file.

```linux
~$ date

~$ date | cut --delimiter=" " --fields=1

2019

// we also want to save the entire date

~$ date | tee fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter= " " --field=1

2019
```



- when I open the fulldate.txt, I can see that all of the data has been indeed saved in that file.

### Mini Challenge

- Instead of having the day the week spit out to the terminal, I want you to see if you can figure out how you can use redirection to actually cause that data to be saved in a filed called today.txt

```linux
~$ date | tee fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter= " " --field=1 > today.txt
```



- Once I've redirected standard output like today.txt, we can no longer do any more piping down than a pipe I'm going to maximize the terminal we can
- But it is possible more piping at the below command line.

```linux
~$ date | tee fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter= " " --field=1 | tee today.txt ...
```





# Piping (Part3) - xargs

- tee command is really useful because by doing normal redirection you can break you pipeline by using tee command, you can save data but also still keep your pipeline flowing. 

```linux
~$ date

~$ echo "Hello"

Hello

~$ date | echo

--> echo doesn't accept standard input. In fact, it only accepts command arguments

~$ date | echo "hello"

hello
```



- The question becomes how we could pass the data from our pipeline into a command that doesn't accept standard input. The key is to convert the data from standard input into command line arguments so the command can continue to work like it normal. 
- 질문: 그렇다면 rm이 일반 텍스트를 마치 파일이나 디렉토리 인것 처럼 여기는가?

```linux
~$ date | xargs echo

Mon 16 Oct 23:55:31 BST 2019
```



- xargs will convert the data from standard input and it will put it instead into a command line arguments

```linux
~$ date | cut --delimiter=" " --fields=1 | echo 
```

- It doesn't work because echo doesn't accept standard input. In order to fix this problem, we can use the word "xargs"

```linux
~$ date | cut --delimiter=" " --fields=1 | xargs echo

Mon

creating deleteme.txt

~$ rm deletemt.txt      --> remove 

~$ cat filestodelete.txt

fulldate.txt

today.txt

~$ cat filestodelete.txt | rm

```



- rm - remove files or directories, therefore, if there are some contents in files or directories which are not files or directories, rm doesn't work. In order to solve this problem we can use xargs rm because 

rm: missing operand

Try 'rm --help' for more information --> because rm command only accepts command line the command line arguments. But it is possible

```linux
~$ cat filestodelete.txt | xargs rm
```

- 이렇게되면 fulldate.txt 랑 today.txt 파일이 삭제됨 신기함.



# Summary

- Piping connects STDOUT of one command to the STDIN of another.
- Redirection of STDOUT breaks pipelines.
- To save a data "snapshot" without breaking pipelines, use the tee command.
- If a command doesn't accept STDIN, but you want to pipe to it, use xargs.
- Commands you use with xargs can still have their own arguments.



Using `xargs` allows tools like `echo` and [`rm`](https://shapeshed.com/unix-rm/) and [`mkdir`](https://shapeshed.com/unix-mkdir/) to accept standard input as arguments.

이 말은 standard input은 argument로 받아들여서 rm이 동작하게하는건데, 왜 aa.txt 안에 123123을 적었을 때 삭제가 되지않을까?  123123은 command line이 아닌가 standard input은 command line argument가 아닌가?
