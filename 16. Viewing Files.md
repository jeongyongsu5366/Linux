# Viewing Files: Part - 1

Goal

- Know how to 5 new commands to manipulate file contents.
- Know how to perform functions on the contents of files.

```linux
~/Desktop$ cat file1.txt
hello
~/Desktop$ cat file2.txt
there
~/Desktop$ cat file3.txt
you
~/Desktop$ cat file4.txt
beautiful
~/Desktop$ cat file5.txt
people
```



```linux
~/Desktop$ cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt
hello
there
you
beautiful
people

~/Desktop$ cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt > beautiful.txt

** it is possible to simply this code
~/Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt > beautiful.txt 

~/Desktop$ echo "abc" >> alpha.txt
~/Desktop$ echo "def" >> alpha.txt
~/Desktop$ cat alpha.txt
abc
def

tac: reads whole files in reverse, just flips it up side and down
~Desktop$ tac alpha.txt
def
abc
~Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt | tac
people
beautiful
you
there
hello
```



- tac: reads whole files in reverse, just flips it up side and down (reverse file vertically).

```linux
~/Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt
hello
there
you
beautiful
people

~/Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt | rev      
olleh
ereht
lufituaeb
elpope
```



- rev: it is reverse along the lines but the order of each line is the same (reverse file horizontally).

- cat, tac, rev: they are taking a file reading it into standard input doing some processing and then just spitting the output to the standard output.
- Technically, cat is not a proper method for dealing with relatively large file.



# Viewing Files: Part - 2

- less (pager): it allows you to page through large output to make it easier to read
- less is able to fix the weak point of the cat command

```linux
~/Desktop$ find -name "*.txt"

~/Desktop$ find | less  
** now we can scroll down line by line

** if you only want to operate a piece of the file
~/Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt
hello
there
you
beautiful
people

~/Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt | head
** head: a little piece of the file starting at the top or the head of the file (by default show first ten lines) and we can change the number of line that we want

~/Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt | head -n 2 (just two lines from the top)

~$ find | head -n 5
~$ find | head -n 5 | tac

~ cat /etc/cups/cups.browsed.conf | wc -l
673
~ head -n 20 /etc/cups/cups.browsed.conf
** like this we don't need to use pipe for using head

~/cd Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt
~/Desktop$ cat file[1-5].txt | tail -n 2
~/Desktop$ tail -n 20 /etc/cups/cups.browsed.conf | tail -n 3

~/Desktop$ head -n 20 /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf | tail -n 1
** we cut out the first 20 lines and cut out the last one line.

~$ find tail -n 3 > ~/Desktop/export.txt
```



- head: a little piece of the file starting at the top or the head of the file (by default show first ten lines)
- tail: It is the opposite of the head command



# Summary

- I can join files together using the cat command.
- Reverse files vertically using the tac command.
- Reverse files horizontally using the rev command.
- Use less to page through large amounts of output.
- Use head and tail to cut out just what you want.
