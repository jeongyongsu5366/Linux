# Creating Bash Scripts: Part - 2

- **Bash** is a Unix **shell**, which is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with an operating system (OS). Any command that you can run from the command line can be used in a **bash script**.**Scripts** are used to run a series of commands. **Bash **is available by default on Linux and macOS operating systems.

```linux
~/Desktop$ vim backup.sh
~/Desktop$ which bash              check where the bash interpreter is
/bin/bash

~/Desktop$ nano backup.sh 
#!/bin.bash         (not read this file as a text file)

tar -czvf backup.tar.gz ~/{Documents,Downloads,Desktop,Pictures,Videos}     
# We've got a backup top target file one our desktop so it's not very cool right
# we want the backup.sh script to compress and archive all of the folders inside our home directory.
```



- c: create a new archive
- v: To make speak to us "next argument is going to be all file".
- #!: The meaning of the symbols are not read this code as a text file but instead to interpret it as a bash script.
- z: To make it as being compressed

```linux
tar -cvzf backup.tar.~/{This is what we actually want to store}

tar -czf backup.tar.gz ~/{Documents,Downloads,Desktop,Pictures,Videos}

~/Desktop$ rm backup.tar.gz

~/Desktop$ bash backup.sh

vim backup.sh
tar -czf backup.tar.gz ~/{Documents,Downloads,Desktop,Pictures,Videos} 2>/dev/null    (delete whatever is sent)        (customize)

```



```linux
~/Desktop$ bash backup.sh
** better backup way

~$ mkdir bin
~$ mv ~/Desktop/backup.sh ~/bin/

~$ cd bin/
~/bin$ ls
backup.sh
~/bin$ mv backup.sh backup

~/bin$ ls
backup        --> Now I need to make this renamed backup file run from the 					command line
~/bin$

one option: backup 파일로 들어가서, property에서 permissions, allow executing file as program

The other option(recommended): 
~/bin$ chmod +x backup
*changed the permission,  +x means executable
~/bin$ ls
backup (green color)

~/bin$ vim backup
make the backup is always saved on the desktop

tar -czf ~/Desktop/backup.tar.gz ~/{Documents,Downloads,Desktop,Pictures,Videos}
```



```linux
Then on Windows
~$ backup
Command 'backup' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install openafs-client

** I notice that The shell say it can't find something that means it's not on the shell search path, so we need to edit the shell search path to include recently created bin folder

** The way to do this 
~$ pwd
/home/yongsu
~$ vim .bashrc 
Then, if you scroll all the way down to the bottom, there is what I want to write

PATH="$PATH:$~/bin
** a variable called path is going to have a path equal to what the currently is then a colon then our home folder slash bin folder.


```



```linux
~$ echo $PATH
At the end of the line /home/Yongsu/bin added and that means it'll be able to search for our backup script in the path just like any other files

~$ backup
~$ cd bin/
~/bin$ vim hello
~/bin$ chmod +x hello
~$ cd Documents$ hello
Hello World!

~$ ~/Documents$ hello > ~/Desktop/hello.txt
~$ cd ~/bin
~$ ~/bin$ ls
backup hello (green color)



I can execute shell script file in everywhere
```





- What is the difference between alias and bash shell ?
  - alias - It is used for a single line command.
  - bash-shell - It is used for multiple lines command, but also it is possible to execute shell.sh file at any time



# Summary

- Bash Scripts allow you to store useful command sequences in files.
- Bash Scripts must have #!/bin/bash as the first line.
- I've seen how to make scripts runnable like regular commands.
- Scripts are more powerful than aliases and can be scheduled.
