# WildCards

- Know how to use wildcards to make your commands more powerful.

Regular Expressing using wildcards

```linux
~$ *(asterisk)

~$ ls *

~$ ls D*

~$ ls 
```

- Using *(asterisk), I don't care about the length of the file.

- Using ?(question mark), I do care about the length of the file.

```linux
~$ ls ??.txt

~$ ls *.txt

~$ ls ?.txt
```



```linux
~$ ls file[1234567890].txt         --> it is the most restrictive way 저 중에 해당되는 것만 출력

~$ ls file?.txt

~$ ls file*.txt

~$ ls file[0-9].txt

~$ ls file[A-Z].txt
```

- What if the name of a file is two digit?

```linux
~$ ls file[0-9] [A-Z].txt

~$ ls file[0-9] [A-Z] [a-z].txt

~$ ls file[0-9ABC].txt

~$ ls file[0-9abc].txt
```



# summary

- Wildcards are used to build patterns called "regular expressions".
- Anything that matches the pattern will be passed as a command line argument to a command
- *(asterisk) matches anything, regardless of length
- ? (question mark) matches anything, but just for one place
- [] matches just one place, but allows you to specify options



# Quiz

Which of these Commands would list all the files in your home directory that ended in `.txt`  (remembering that `~`  means "home directory")

- ls ~/*.txt

Which of these regular expressions would match these files: 
`important_report1A.pdf` , `important_report1B.pdf` , `important_report1C.pdf` 

- *[0-9] [A-Z].pdf
