# Creating Files and Directories - Part1

Goal

- Know how to use touch and mkdir commands to create files and directories.
- Be able to create your own files and folders using command line.

```linux
touch file1

touch ~/Documents/distantfile

mkdir folder 

mkdir ~/Pictures/holiday

mkdir bla/thing/shablam --> doesn't work

mkdir -p bla/thing/shablam --> it works

mkdir happy birthday --> watch out spacing  (two directories created)

mkdir "happy birthday" --> only one directory

mkdir "happy_birthday" 
```

- All of command in Linux is case-sensitive



# Creating Files and Directories - Part2

- Brace Expansion

```linux
~$ cd Desktop/

~/Desktop/project$ mkdir    (without spacing){jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_{2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022}

```

- First, creating folder or directory
- Second, creating file through touch

```linux
~/Desktop/project$ mkdir    (without spacing){jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_{2017..2022}

~/Desktop/project$ touch {jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_{2017..2022}/file{1..100}

```

- Each file has a hundred of files(file1~100)

- Total + 72 folders * 100 files

```linux
~$ ls {jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_{2017}

~$ ls {jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_{2017} > out.txt

cat out.txt
```



```linux
~/Desktop$ touch fileA.txt fileB.txt fileC.txt

~/Desktop$ touch file{A,B,C}.txt

~/Desktop$ touch file{A..C}.txt

모두 똑같은 파일을 생성하는 command
```

# Summary

- touch is used to create files
- mkdir command is used to create directories
- mkdir - p can be used to create entire folder paths
- Don't put spaces in your filenames. Use underscores instead
- Brace expansion can be used to do very complicated things.





# Quiz

How would you create a new file called report.txt in the Documents folder in your Home Directory? 

- touch ~/Documents/report.txt
  

How would we create a folder called "holiday" in the Pictures directory within our home folder?

- mkdir ~/Pictures/holiday

     

How would we create a folder called A and inside of that, a folder called B and inside of that a folder called C, all in one go?

- mkdir -p A/B/C
