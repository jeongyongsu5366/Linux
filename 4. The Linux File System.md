Under the bob directory:
Desktop Document Downloads Music Pictures Public Template Videos

under the downloads directory:

file1.txt, pic.jpg ...

- The root user on the system is similar to the administrator in windows on Linux.

# Navigating The File System



- Goal: Be able to know where you are on your file system and know what's around you by using command line
- Tilda: ~ (home directory)

```linux
~$ pwd: Print Working Directory

/home/yongsu

~$ ls: list directory contents

~$ ls /home/yongsu --> which is a long way

~$ ls ~ --> short-cut

~$ echo "Hello" > file.txt
```



- So we can see that the ls command allows us to see the difference between files and folders files 

```linux
~$ ls -F > list.txt  --> Have a slash at the end of folders, which has emphasis function

~$ ls --> show the file size in byte

~$ ls -l --> long form

~$ ls -lh --> human readable version

```
