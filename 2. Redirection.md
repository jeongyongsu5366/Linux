# Redirection: 

- Redirection is a feature in **Linux** such that when executing a command, you can change the standard input/output devices. The basic workflow of any **Linux** command is that it takes an input and give an output. The standard input (stdin) device is the keyboard.

- cat: reads from standard input and writes to standard output

```linux
~$ cat

meow

meow
```

- When I want to redirect standard output to a file called output.txt
- standard output is number one
- standard error is number two

```linux
~$ cat 1> output.txt

Linux is amazing!
```

- Then, check the folder! 
- I don't actually need to write down number one

```linux
~$ cat > output.txt

Linux is amazing!
```

- It works as well

- spacing is very important. 

```linux
cat 1 > output.txt (This is not fine)

cat 1> output.txt  (This is fine)
```

- Let's try adding more text to the file

```linux
~$ cat 1> output.txt

wow!
```

- When we open it, it just says the word 'wow!'
- What happened to the text it says "Linux is amazing"?
- It is because redirection **by default will remove everything in a file before writing to it**.
- The fancy word for that situation is called **"truncation"**.

We can solve that problem with using two arrows there

```linux
~$ cat 1>> output.txt     ## The truncation is solved!

Linux is amazing!
```



- When looking inside of the file, it shows up "wow" "Linux is amazing" without occurring truncation



# Summary

- Data Streams have numbers associated with them.
  - The data stream number zero is standard input.       
  - The data stream number one is standard output.       
  - The data stream number two is standard error.

- Be careful of truncating my files!

- I have seen how to redirect standard output (Data stream 1)







# Redirection_Part2

- Recap: One arrow will delete everything in file before writing to it (**"truncation"**).
  -   Two arrows will concatenate new content with existing one without occurring truncation.

- cat command doesn't have the -k option

```linux
~$ cat -k bla

cat: Invalid option -- 'k'

Try 'cat --help' for more information

~$ cat -k bla 2> error.txt          --> Nothing popped out on our terminal

```



- The error message is sent to error.txt file.
- If using two arrows, I am able to append each error on top of each other. 

```linux
~$ cat 1> output.txt 2>> error.txt

Linux is amazing!
```



- error.txt doesn't contain anything because there's no errors from this output

```linux
~$ cat > output.txt 2>>error.txt   --> I can only get rid of the number one for the standard output data stream.

Linux is very amazing!
```



- Standard Input is relatively straightforward at the moment the cat command is looking for standard input from keyboard. What if we told it to get standard input from a file instead?

```linux
~$ cat > input.txt

Hello World!
```

- The standard input stream has the number of zero

```linux
~$ cat 0< input.txt       --> I don't even need the zero 

~$ cat < input.txt  (It is fine)

Hello World!
```



##### Mini Challenge: Getting cat to read standard input from input.txt and redirect the output Hello.txt

```linux
~$ cat 0< input.txt 1> hello.txt 

```

- Everything in Linux is actually treated the same as a file, even terminals.

```linux
~$ tty : tty command will actually tell us where this terminal is located where on the file system it is.

VirtualBoxA: tty : /dev/pts/4

VirtualBoxB: tty :/dev/pts/3

cat 0< input.txt > /dev/pts/3, when I press Enter, we can see that the data has been passed from one terminal to another.
```



## Summary

- Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error are Data Streams.

- Using redirection you can control where those streams "flow".

- Standard Input = 0, Standard Output = 1, Standard Error = 2.

  (> will overwrite a file before writing to it!!)

  (>> will append to what's already there)
