# Terminals, Commands and Shells

- Commands are just text you type in terminal.
- Commands are interpreted by the shell.
- Different shells can interpret the same text in different ways.
- The terminal is the window to the shell.
- Bonus Point: Commands are case-sensitive.

- Command = commandName  -options inputs
- CommandNames need to be on th shell's search path
- Commands operate on inputs
- Options modify a command's behaviour


# Using The Linux Manual
- The Manual Page(Man) Pages!
- How the manual is structured.

# Manual Structure
1. User Commands       **
2. System Calls
3. C Library Functions
4. Devices and Special Files
5. File Formats and Conventions **
6. Games
7. Miscellaneous
8. System Aministration  **

```linux
~$ man -k which    --> Search
~$ man 1 which
~$ man 6 sol
~$ man lcf
~$ man which

~$ which date cal
// give us the location of the file

~$ which [-a | -f] <something> --> which is called a pipe, which means you have to pick one or the other, you cannot pick both of them. 
```

- I saw how to search the manual pages using man -k
- How to read the manual pages for specific command structure


# Using the Linux Manual - Putting it all together
```linux
~$ man -k "Lis directory content"

```

man ls
ls : list dirctory contents

ls -l : use a long listing format, much more detailed than ls
ls -lh: human readable
ls --human-readable

help cd (instead of man) --> change the shell working directory

help (enter)

man pwd --> print name of current/working directory

man -k "list directory contents"


Case-Sensitive!!!


# Command Input + Output
- Each linux command is designed to do one thing incredibly well!!
- I will understand the ways data flows into and out of a command
- Be ready to connect commands together to build powerful pipelines

- man cat : concatenate files and print on the standard output
- cat , in order to cancer it, hit ctrl + c

- There are 2 ways to get data into a command 2 ways to get data out
- Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error are Standard Data Streams.
- Data streams can be redirected from their default locations to wherever you wish
- You can redirect the standard output of one command to the standard input of another in a process known as "piping"
