# File Archiving + Compression: Part - 1

Goals

- Know how to Archive and Compress Files in Linux.

- Know how to create and restore backups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



- Tarball is basically creating a way of putting your files in a bag to make them easier to compress and them easier to store. When you add files to a tarball, you make it possible to store all of your files in one place. The tarball itself doesn't do any compression but tarball can be compressed using compression algorithms.
- 1. Make tarball 
  2. Compress tarball
- c:  we want to create new archive
- v: speaks to what's going on
- f:  we can accept files



```linux
~/Desktop$ ls -lh

~/Desktop$ tar -cvf ourarchive.tar file[1.3].txt
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt

~/Desktop$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt (ourarchive.tar red-color and box-shaped)

~/Desktop$ ls -l | grep .tar
** 용량이 40960 왜 이렇게 크지 생각할 수 있지만, 쇼핑가방에 사과를 담는다고 생각하면된다, 사과 하나가 100g이고 3개를 담으면 300g이라 생각할 수 있지만, 쇼핑가방 무게까지 포함해야하고, 이 비유를 그대로 tarball 박스에 적용하면 이해가쉽다. (which is called extra weight)


~/Desktop$ file ourarchieve.tar
~/Desktop$ mv ourarchive.tar ourarchieve.shablam
~/Desktop$ file ourarchieve.shablam
it still prints out tar archive



~/Desktop$ tar -tf ourarchive.tar    (check what's inside of it)
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt



~/Desktop$ rm file?.txt
** now label disappearing

~/Desktop$ tar -xvf ourarchive.tar      (x: extract)
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
** it is still inside of ourarchive!.

```



- File extension doesn't mean anything in Linux.

- t: test label, it basically lets you check what's inside the file.
- f: it's just necessary in order to pass a file to tar command.



# Compression

- Compression happens using compression algorithms in use in Linux world.

- gzip: faster but has less compression power
- bzip2: generally it can compress files to a smaller size than gzip, but it requires more computational time.

```linux
~/Desktop$ gzip ourarchive.tar
~/Desktop$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt (ourarchive.tar.gz)(red-color, gz)
~/Desktop$ file ourarchive.gz
gzip compressed data, was "ourarchive.tar"

~/Desktop$ ls -lh
size of ourarchive.tar is 23023
file1.txt is 10000, now compression files to a smaller size than before!

** in order to unzip
~/Desktop$ gunzip ourarchive.tar.gz
~/Desktop$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt ourarchive.tar

~/Desktop$ file ourarchive.tar
~~~

** it is heavy duty
~/Desktop$ bzip2 ourarchive.tar
~/Desktop$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt ourarchive.bz2

~/Desktop$ file ourarchive.tar.bz2
~/Desktop$ ls -l ourarchive.tar.bz2
it is 23137, so bzip is good for a far larger file such as a video


~/Desktop$ bunzip2 ourarchive.tar.bz2
~/Desktop$ file ourarchive.tar
~~

```



```linux
** It is commonly used in window and mac, one step process
~/Desktop$ zip ourthing.zip file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
~/Desktop$ file ourthing.zip

** If yo want to unzip it
~/Desktop$ unzip ourthing.zip

```



```linux
**we can make two steps zip

~/Desktop$ tar -cvf ourarchive.tar file[1.3].txt
** For compression, we need one more step, but we can archive and zip at the same time like this code

~/Desktop$ tar -cvzf ourarchive.tar.gz file[1.3].txt
~/Desktop$ ls
gzip compressed data

~/Desktop$ tar -cvjf ourarhive.tar.bz2 file[1.3].txt
~/Desktop$ file orarchive.tar.bz2
bzip2 compressed data


** we normally extract it like this
~/Desktop$ tar -xvzf ourarchive.tar.gz
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt

~/Desktop$ tar -xvjf ourarchive.tar.bz2
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt

You can extract and compress all in one go
```



# Summary

- Tarballs are containers to store files in for compression.
- Tarballs can be compressed using various compression algorithms.
- gzip and bzip2 are common options on Linux. xz is another option.
- gzip: faster, lower compression
- bzip2: take more computational time, but give more compression
- You can also use the zip and unzip commands to create/extract .zip files
- Saw how to do archiving and compression in one step.
