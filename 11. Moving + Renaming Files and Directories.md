- Know how to  use mv command to move and rename files and folders

```linux
mv - move (rename) files

mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

```linux
mkdir oldfolder

mv oldfolder/newfolder
```

- Renaming folder doesn't damage any of the contents inside



- mv (what we want to move)    (where you want to move)

```linux
mv newfolder/* .      (move everything *의미 in newfolder in . dot(current location Desktop)) 
```

```linux
mv newfolder/ destination/

mv file* newfolder/

mv newfolder/ ~/Documents/ ./jackpot (To Desktop)

change the name of newfolder in Documents folder
```
