# Deleting Files and Directories - Part 1

Goal

- Know how to use the rm command to delete files.
- Know how to sue the rm command with wildcards.
- Know how to delete files using the command line.

```linux
touch Documents/deleteme

rm delete --> error occuring

rm Documents/deleteme --> no error

touch file1.txt

touch Documents/file2.txt

touch Documents/file3.txt

rm file1.txt 



touch file1.txt file2.png file3.jpg
```

- How to delete those files?

- Option1: manually delete one by one

```linux
rm file1.txt file4.txt
```



- Option2: giving command pattern

```linux
rm *.txt   (star means anything)
```



```linux
rm file*  (file1,file2,file3,file4 will be deleted)



touch file1.txt file2.png file3.jpg file4.txt

how to delete all these files at once?

rm  * 2*  (file2 and shablam2 have been deleted) (doesn't matter what it ends in)

rm *.jpg (three dot jpg deleted)

rm *.txt



touch file1.txt file2.png file3.jpg file4.txt

touch shablam1.txt shablam2.png shablam3.jpg

rm *[2,3] * (no spacing) 2 or 3      --> file2 file3 shablam2 shablam3 are deleted
```



# Summary

- The rm command is used to remove items from your file system.
- Wildcards can be used to make commands even more powerful.





# Deleting Files and Directories - Part 2



Goal

- Know how to use the rm and rmdir commands to delete folders.



```linux
mkdir delfolder

rm delfolder/

rm: cannot remove 'delfolder/': Is a directory
```



but, it can be solved as giving -r (recursive) option to rm because if you delete something recursively that means you'll delete that thing and everything else inside

```linux
rm -r delfolder/

순서대로

~$ mkdir delfolder

~$ mkdir delfolder/deleteme{1,2,3}

~$ touch delfolder/deleteme{1,2,3}/file{1,2,3}

~$ rm -r delfolder
```



```linux
~$ rm -ri      (recursive + interaction)
```



```linux
~$ mkdir -p(which allows me to create an entire path) delfolder/deleteme{1,2,3}

~$ touch delfolder/deleteme{1,2,3}/file{1,2,3}

~$ rm -ri delfolder/  

```



- There is another option that only remove empty directory.

```linux
~$ rm -r delfolder/

~$ mkdir -p delfolder/folder{1..3}

~$ touch delfolder/folder{1,2}/file{1..10}.txt

rmdir delfolder/*

rmdir: failed to remove "delfolder/folder1": Directory not empty

rmdir is only used when directory is empty
```





# Summary

- The rm command needs to r option to delete folder (Be careful)
- The i option will allow the rm command to be interactive when deleting.
- The rmdir command will only delete folders that are empty.
