# The Find Command: Part - 1

Goal

- Know how to use the find command's default behavior.
- Know how to control search depth.
- Know how to search by type (files or directories).
- Know how to search by name.
- Know how to search by file size.
- Know how to execute other commands on search results.

```linux
**default behavior of the find command is to list every single fine and every single folder there lower down in our file system then the current folder that we're in. 즉, a 라는 current folder에 b라는 폴더가 있고 그 안에 c라는 파일이 있으면 c,b,a 순으로 위치를 다 출력해준다. Current Folder 포함 하위 폴더의 위치를 모조리 다 출력한다.

~$ find
```

- The find command will list out files and folders but the locate command will only list files. The find command does not need a database in order to work, it directly works in my files. It is lightly slower than using a database.

```linux
** The find command will list every single file below where you give it,

~$ find /  (root so entire system will be found)
~$ find /home/yongsu/Documents

** create multiple folder inside of Docuements folder and try to use the find command again and check the results!
```

* I am currently in folder is by default!!





# The Find Command: Part - 2

```linux
~/Documents$ find
./level2
./level2/level3
./level2/level3/level4
./level2/level3/level4/4.txt
./level2/level3/level4/level5
./level2/level3/level4/level5/5.txt
./level2/level3/3.txt
./level2/2.txt

~/Documents$ find . -maxdepth 1 (write any number you want)
.           ** dot means this directory
./level2
```



```linux
~/Documents$ find
./level2
./level2/level3
./level2/level3/level4
./level2/level3/level4/4.txt
./level2/level3/level4/level5
./level2/level3/level4/level5/5.txt
./level2/level3/3.txt
./level2/2.txt

~/Documents$ find -type f           ** we just get the files
./level2/level3/level4/4.txt
./level2/level3/level4/level5/5.txt
./level2/level3/3.txt
./level2/2.txt 

~/Documents$ find -type d           ** we just get the directories(folder)
.
./level2
./level2/level3
./level2/level3/level4
./level2/level3/level4/level5

~/Document$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type d  **maxdept first and type d
~/Document$ find . -maxdepth 2 -type f  **maxdept first and type f

```







# The Find Command: Part - 3

- Know how to search for something by name

Now I am in Home Directory and want to find the 5.txt file. How to find it?

```linux
~$ find . -name "5.txt"
./Documents/level2/level3/level4/level5/5.txt

~$ find . -name "*.txt"
** It is possible to find every files ended .txt

~$ find . -maxdepth 2 -name "*.txt"
~$ find . -maxdepth 10 -name "?.txt"         **Using wildcards

~$ find . -maxdepth 2 -iname "?.TXT"          **insensitivity - doesn't care about case
```



- It is possible to find files by theirs size.

```linux
~$ find / -type f -size +100k
** starts from the very base of the system / , and looking for files and its size is greater than 100kilobytes

** one thing to notice is that we are not able to access every files because of the level of authority. So in order to expand the level of access, we can code like this.
~ sudo find / -type f -size +100k | wc -l

** wc will count amount of the line (How many lines are there?)

~$ sudo find / -type f -size +100k -size -5M | wc -l
** The file has to be bigger than 100k and less than 5M

~$ sudo find / -type f -size -100k +5M | wc -l
result is 0 because it is impossble range

~$ sudo find / -type f -size -100k -o +5M | wc - 1
** the meaning of the symbol -o is or

~$ find -name " " ** we can use wildcards, regular expression, etc..
```







# The Find Command: Part - 4

```linux
~/Desktop$ mkdir copy_here
~/Desktop$ sudo find / -type f -size +100k -size 5M | wc -l
** find every single file in this system /,

~/Desktop$ sudo find / -type f -size +100k -size 5M -exec cp What Where
** -exec is used for executing another command

~/Desktop$ sudo find / -type f -size +100k -size 5M -exec cp {} ~/Desktop/copy_here \:
** \: it means completed finished 
** this code is copying and pasting every files to copy_here folder

~/Desktop$ sudo find / -maxdepth 3 -type f -size +100k -size 5M -exec cp {} ~/Desktop/copy_here \:

~/Desktop$ sudo find / -maxdepth 3 -type f -size +100k -size 5M -ok cp {} ~/Desktop/copy_here \:

-ok option is similar with interaction option, whenever it starts something, ask for us if it is okay to execute or not.
```





# The Find Command: Part - 5

```linux
~/Desktop$ mkdir haystack
~/Desktop$ mkdir haystack/folder{1..500}
~/Desktop$ touch haystack/folder{1..500}/file{1..100}

~/Desktop$ tocuh haystack/folder${shuf -i 1-500 -n 1}/needle.txt
** one of the folder from 1 to 500, we are going to find a file called needle.txt
** but we can find it through using find
~/Desktop$ find haystack/ -type -f -name "needle.txt"

~/Desktop$ find haystack/ -type -f -name "needle.txt" -exec mv {} -/Desktop \:
** It is possible to find neeld.txt file at the destktop folder because we have moved the needle.txt file to desktop folder through using -exec and mv command.
```







# Summary

- The find command can be used to execute sophisticated search tasks.
- You can search by -name, -type, -size and so much more (see man page).
- You can use the -exec option to execute another command on each of the results - remember to end with \:   (we can use -ok (interactive) option as well :D)



# Quiz

The `find`  command uses a database in order to do its searching.

- No, the find command doesn't need to use a database.  



How would we get the `find`  command to start at the `/etc`  folder and limit its search to only 4 levels deep?

- find /etc -maxdepth 4  



How would you limit the `find`  command to start searching from the `/etc`  folder but limit the search to 4 levels of depth and also only show directories?

- find /etc -maxdepth 4 -type d
    

How would we use the find command to list all the files on our file system that have file names ending in ".txt", starting from the base of the file system (the / directory)?

- find / -type f -name "*.txt"  



How would you use the `find`  command to start searching from the `/etc`  folder up to a maximum of 4 levels deep for all files that are over 100 KibiBytes in size?

- find /etc -maxdepth 4 -type f -size +100k
    

How would you use the `find`  command to  search for every file below your home directory that is over 5 MebiBytes in size and execute the `rm`  command on the results?

- find ~ -type f -size +5M -exec rm {} \m
