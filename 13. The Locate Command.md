# The Locate Command: Part - 1

- Know how to use the locate command and its options.
- Understand some of the limitations of the locate command.



**The locate command**: It works by searching a database file on my system. This database holds location information about every file. This locate command works by giving it some pattern and then it will search the database for every path that matches that pattern and give it back to me on standard output.



```linux
~$ .conf
```



.conf: It is a file extension that is common on Linux to indicate that this file is editable configuration.

```linux
~$ .log
```



.log: It is used for storing error messages from programs and server applications. So It is possible to find it in case anything breaks and see where the stuff goes wrong.



**First Pattern**

```linux
~$ locate *.conf
```

- I will see every single one of this files end in dot .conf 

- It is worth noting that by default Linux is case-sensitive and it is possible to change this default.

```linux
~$ locate -i *.conf 			or 			~$ locate -i *.CONF
```

- Now its default is case-insensitive

- It is like hey don't worry about case!

```linux
~$ locate -i --limit (the number of output you want)*.conf
**if you want to get just three results, you can code like this
~$ locate -i --limit 3 *.conf
```



- It is possible to limit the number of output results by using --limit + number

```linux
~$ locate -S
```



- Using -S option we can get database information

```linux
~$ locate -S > ~/Desktop/database_before.txt
```



- We can use redirection for storing database information, and this database is only useful if the information in it is up to date. 
- The database by default is updated just once a day.
- This means that anything that happens in the mean time is not logged in the database, files could be created and deleted. Unless the database is updated the locate command will start to give incorrect results. Therefore, there are a few options that come with the locate command to help minimize this issue.

- The previous mentioned option can prevent the locate command from showing files that have been deleted.
- There is the option that requires the locate command to check that the file is existing before it reports it back. 

```linux
~$ locate -e *.conf               or           ~$ locate --existing *.conf
```



- not only does it check every files ended in .conf, but also check to make sure that those files actually existed before reporting them rather than just taking it from database directly. So it gives us that extra bit of assurance.

```linux
~ locate --existing --follow -i --limit 5 *.conf
```



- For maximum assurance we can code like the above



# The Locate Command: Part - 2

Goal

- Know how to update the database using the updatedb command.
- Know how to gain superuser privileges using the sudo command.



```linux
~/Desktop$ touch findme.txt
~/Desktop$ locate findme.txt 

** nothing is showed up because findeme file has been created before our database has been updated. Therefore, we cannot find the findeme.txt file until the database has been updated.

** In order to solve this issue, we can use updatedb
~/Desktop$ updatedb
can not open a temporary file for ...

** The reason for the error is the update D-B command requires administrator privileges in order to run.

** we can get administrator privileges using "sudo"
~/Desktop$ sudo updatedb
[sudo] password for yongsu:

** now locate findme.txt works
~/Desktop$ locate findme.txt  

** we can compare the number of files in database
~/Desktop$ locate -S > database_after.txt
~/Desktop$ locate -S > database_after2.txt
```





# Summary

- The locate command searches a database for files and returns a list of results.
- Using a database is very fast, but requires updating.
- To help protect against errors you can use the --existing and --follow options.
- Best thing to do is just update the database (done automatically daily).
- This requires admin privileges and therefore the sudo command is used.
