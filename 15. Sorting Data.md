# Sorting Data: Part - 1

Goal

- Know how to sort data to make it easier to process in pipelines.

```linux
** sort it alphabatically - default value
~/Desktop$ sort word.txt
alphabatically sorted

~/Desktop $ sort words.txt > sorted.txt

** how to sort it in reverse
~/Desktop$ sort words.txt txt | tac

** better way     (r option : stands for reverse)
~/Desktop$ sort -r words.txt
~/Desktop$ sort -r words.txt | less

```



- How would we sort numbers?

```linux
~/Desktop$ sort number.txt | less      **(It is sorted by first digit)
~/Desktop$ sort -n number.txt | less    **(-n option: sorting numerically)
~/Desktop$ sort -nr number.txt | less   **(-nr: numerically reverse)
```



```linux
~/Desktop$ sort numbers0-9.txt | less
** we can use u option which stands for unique, no repeat number

~/Desktop$ sort -u numbers0-9.txt
~/Desktop$ sort -ur numbers0-9.txt
```



# Summary

- You can sort data using the sort command.
- The sort command tends to sort "smallest first" (a-z, 0-9 etc)
- You can reverse this using the -r option.
- To sort numerically give the -n option.
- To only prove unique results, use the -u option.



# Sorting Data: Part - 2

```linux
~$ ls -l /etc   (etc contains all of the system's configuration)
~$ ls -l /etc | head -n 20

~$ ls -l /tec | head -n 20 | sort -k 5n
** -k (key option): what column is sorted by
(example) ls -l
a a a a a 
1 2 3 4 5

~$ ls -l /etc | head -n 20 | sort -k 5nr
~$ ls -lh (human readable) /etc | head -n 20 | sort -k 5hr (human readable) 

~$ ls -lh /etc | head -n 20| sort -k 6MT

~$ ls -lh /etc | head -n 20| sort -k 2n      (sort numerically, sort smallest first)

~$ ls -lh /etc | head -n 20| sort -k 2nr      (sort numerically, sort biggest first (reverse))

```



# Summary

- You can sort tabular data using the -k option.
- You need to give the -k option a KEYDEF.
- 3nr means sort using column 3, and use the -n and -r options.

- To sort human-readable data use the -h option not -n.
- To sort month data use the -M option.
- Order of options in the KEYDEF don't matter (as usual)
