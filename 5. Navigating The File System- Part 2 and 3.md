Goals

```linux
cd: stands for change directory

~$ cd /home/yongsu/Downloads



~$ cd /home/yongsu/

~$ cd --> ended back in our home directory

~$ ls -a
```



Beginning with dot means it is a hidden file.

.          : 그대로 (current folder)

..         : 부모 폴더로 (parent folder)

Blue one: Folder 

White one: File
