# File Extensions in Linux

Goal

- Deep Dive on File Extension in Linux.
- Understand the freedoms that Linux gives you with file extension.
- Know what to be aware of when naming files.
- Have learned a new command.

```linux
file Tux.png

Rename it

file tux.jpg

Even though the file name is changed, when executing file Tux.jpg, it still says PNG image data, which is very noticeable point in Linux.
```



- Linux doesn't determine file type by file extension unlike windows. Instead of it, Linux reads a piece of code inserted at the top of every file and that piece of code is known as a header and it serves as a kind of label for Linux to read and when Linux reads that label it knows the file type.

- In other words, just changing the name of the file won't make a bit of difference because that file header won't have changed

```linux
file shake.txt 0 it tells us ASCII text

rename it

file shake.pdf - it still tells us ASCII text

```



- Important point number two: although the operating system will know what file format, the actual file is by reading the header. The extra programs that are installed on top of the operating system such as this PDA viewer are trying to open the files that might require a certain format or extension. But the content is still a text.



- OS doesn't care the type of the file.

- Viewer cares the type of the file.

- File extension isn't important to the Linux operating system but it might be important to the software packages that we installed on the top of Linux.



# Summary

- Use the file command to know what type of file you are dealing with
- You can name files whatever you want in Linux (even .shablam)
- Try not confuse third party software!
