#  Bash Scripts

Goals

- Know how to create your own bash scripts

- I'll have a fundamental understanding of how bash scripts work so that you can begin to automate your workflows.

```linux
~/Desktop$ nano our_script.sh
Then, press ctrl + o and save it
~/Desktop$ file out_script.sh
out_script.sh: empty
```

- Whenever you write bash script, you need to tell it that this is actually a special file and also isn't just a text file.
- It needs to be read using a certain interpreter. The interpreter is something that will read a file and interpret each of the lines in that file as a certain type of code.

```linux
** It needs to be interpreted as code and more specificaly as a bash script.

~/Desktop$ nano our_script.sh
#!/bin/bash    *this /bin/bash is the path to a bash interpreter. We can search for it thorough which bash

~/Desktop$ which bash
/bin/bash
```

```linux
#!/bin/bash  **this key is the line needs to be first line, it cannot be the second line

~/Desktop$ file our_script.sh
our_script.sh: Bourne-Again shell script. ASCII text executable
                (which is shell)

~/Desktop$ which python3
/bin/bash/python3 

파이썬 또한 bash script를 사용함
```

```linux
~/Desktop$ nano our_script.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"    ** This line will be interpreted as a command

~/Desktop$ bash our_script.sh   ** bash야 해석하거라하면
Hello World
```



```linux
~/Desktop$ nano our_script.sh
#!/bin/bash

mkdir ~/Desktop/magic
cd ~/Desktop/magic
touch file{1..100}
ls -lh ~/Desktop/magic > ~/Desktop/magic.log  (human-readable) 

~/Desktop$ cat our_script.sh
~/Desktop$ bash our_script.sh 
** Create folder on Desktop folder, and there is the magic folder and inside of this folder, there are a hundred of files, and in magic.log file we can see detailed information about every single one of files inside the magic folder.
```



- In Linux you can control anything using the command line whatever you want whenever you want to change, also you can write scripts to hold command line commands.
